# Functional-observer-Design-with-sampled-measurement
This project implements the design of linear and nonlinear functional observers for continuous-time systems with sampled measurements and unknown inputs. Based on LMI-based stability conditions, the observer estimates selected state functions rather than full states, reducing complexity while ensuring bounded and stable estimation performance.
